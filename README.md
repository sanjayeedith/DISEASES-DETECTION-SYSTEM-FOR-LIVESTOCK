The economic stability of agricultural communities, animal welfare, and  global food security are all seriously threatened by livestock illnesses. Systems  for detecting effective diseases are essential to reducing these difficulties.

Clinical observation has long been the cornerstone of illness 
identification in livestock, allowing skilled veterinarians to evaluate physical 
signs and behavioural abnormalities. This method is not without its drawbacks, 
though, especially when it comes to diagnosing illnesses in their early stages or 
differentiating between minute differences in symptoms. This environment has 
completely changed due to recent breakthroughs in diagnostic technology, 
which provide faster and more accurate ways to identify diseases. 

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are two examples of modern molecular 
techniques that allow for the precise and sensitive detection of particular 
diseases. Furthermore, the introduction of next-generation sequencing has made 
it easier to do thorough genomic analyses, which has improved our knowledge of 
the hereditary causes of many illnesses and aid in the creation of focused 
interventions. 

In addition to conventional approaches and molecular techniques, 
sensor-based monitoring systems have become effective instruments for ongoing 
animal health surveillance. Wearable technology with built-in sensors may 
track important metrics like heart rate, body temperature, and activity patterns.
